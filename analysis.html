      examination and evaluation of financial data, market trends, economic
      indicators, and other relevant information to make informed investment

        financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and
        cash flow statement, to assess its financial health and performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Market Analysis:</strong> This includes studying market trends,
        industry dynamics, and competitive landscapes to understand the broader
        context in which an investment operates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Economic Analysis:</strong> This involves evaluating
        macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, inflation, GDP growth,
