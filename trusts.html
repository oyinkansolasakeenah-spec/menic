      <h1>Trusts</h1>
    </section>
    <p>
      A <strong>trust</strong> is a legal arrangement in which one party, known
      as the <em>trustor</em> or <em>grantor</em>, transfers assets to another
      party, called the <em>trustee</em>, to hold and manage for the benefit of
      a third party, known as the <em>beneficiary</em>. Trusts are commonly used
      for estate planning, asset protection, and managing wealth for minors or
      individuals with special needs.
    </p>
    <h2 class="container3">Key Components of a Trust</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Trustor/Grantor:</strong> The person who creates the trust and
        transfers assets into it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trustee:</strong> The individual or institution responsible for
        managing the trust's assets according to the terms set forth in the
        trust document.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beneficiary:</strong> The person or entity that benefits from
        the trust, receiving income or principal as specified by the trustor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trust Document:</strong> A legal document that outlines the
        terms and conditions of the trust, including how assets are to be
        managed and distributed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="container4">Types of Trusts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Revocable Trust:</strong> A trust that can be altered or revoked
        by the trustor during their lifetime. It offers flexibility and is
        commonly used for estate planning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Irrevocable Trust:</strong> A trust that cannot be changed or
        revoked once established. It provides asset protection and potential tax
        benefits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Living Trust:</strong> A trust created during the trustor's
        lifetime to manage assets and avoid probate upon their death.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testamentary Trust:</strong> A trust established through a will
        that takes effect upon the death of the trustor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="container5">How to Invest</h3>
    <p>
      To invest in a trust, you typically need to work with a financial advisor
      or an attorney who specializes in trusts and estate planning. They can
      help you determine the best type of trust for your needs, draft the
      necessary legal documents, and guide you through the process of funding
      the trust with your assets.
    </p>
    <h3 class="container6">Difference from Private/Estate Planning Trusts</h3>
    <p>
      While all trusts serve the purpose of managing and protecting assets,
      private trusts and estate planning trusts are specific types of trusts
      used for personal wealth management and inheritance planning. Private
      trusts are often established for high-net-worth individuals to manage
      their wealth privately, while estate planning trusts focus on the
      distribution of assets after death, minimizing taxes, and avoiding
      probate.
    </p>
    <h3 class="container6">Benefits of Trusts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Asset Protection: Trusts can shield assets from creditors and legal
        claims.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tax Efficiency: Certain trusts can provide tax advantages for income and
        estate taxes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Control Over Distribution: Trusts allow the trustor to specify how and
        when beneficiaries receive assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Privacy: Trusts can help keep financial matters private, as they do not
        go through probate.
      </li>
    </ul>
