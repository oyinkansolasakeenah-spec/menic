      <h1>Mutual Funds</h1>
      <p>
        A <strong>mutual fund</strong> is an investment vehicle that pools money
        from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities
        like stocks, bonds, and money market instruments, all managed by
        professional fund managers.
      </p>
      <h2>How They Work</h2>
      <p>
        When you invest in a mutual fund, you buy shares (or units) in the fund,
        becoming a part-owner of all its underlying assets. The fund manager
        makes investment decisions (buying and selling securities) on your
        behalf, aiming to achieve the fund's stated investment objectives.
      </p>

      <ul class="how">
        <li>
          <strong>Net Asset Value (NAV):</strong> The price of a mutual fund
          share is calculated once daily, after the market closes, based on the
          total value of all securities in the portfolio, minus expenses,
          divided by the number of outstanding shares.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Pooling money:</strong> A mutual fund collects funds from
          numerous investors to create a large pool of capital
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Professional management:</strong> A professional fund manager
          invests this pooled money in a variety of securities, such as stocks,
          bonds, and money market instruments.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Diversification:</strong> By spreading investments across many
          different assets, mutual funds reduce the risk associated with any
          single investment. If one security performs poorly, its effect on the
          overall fund is minimized.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Professional expertise</strong> Fund managers analyze
          investments and make decisions to achieve the fund's objectives,
          providing professional management for investors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <h2>How investors make money</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Periodic distribution:</strong> Investors receive a share of
            the fund's income, which can be distributed on a regular basis
            (e.g., quarterly, bi-annually). This is common in funds that focus
            on low-risk money market instruments.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Capital gains:</strong> The value of an investor's shares
            (units) in the fund can increase if the underlying securities
            perform well. If the price per unit rises, you can sell your units
            for a profit.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Key advantages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Diversification:</strong> Reduces the risk by spreading
            investments across various assets.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Professional management:</strong> Provides access to expert
            management and research.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Allows investors with small amounts
            of money to participate in a large, diversified portfolio.

        <h2>Things to consider</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Returns are not guaranteed:</strong> Mutual fund returns are
            not guaranteed and can be affected by poor performance.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Management fees:</strong> The fund manager deducts costs for
            operations, which can vary depending on how actively managed the
            fund is.
