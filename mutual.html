      <h1>Mutual Funds</h1>
      <p>
        A <strong>mutual fund</strong> is an investment vehicle that pools money
        from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities
        like stocks, bonds, and money market instruments, all managed by
        professional fund managers.
      </p>
      <h2>How They Work</h2>
      <p>
        When you invest in a mutual fund, you buy shares (or units) in the fund,
        becoming a part-owner of all its underlying assets. The fund manager
        makes investment decisions (buying and selling securities) on your
        behalf, aiming to achieve the fund's stated investment objectives.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Net Asset Value (NAV):</strong> The price of a mutual fund
          share is calculated once daily, after the market closes, based on the
          total value of all securities in the portfolio, minus expenses,
          divided by the number of outstanding shares.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Pooling money:</strong> A mutual fund collects funds from
          numerous investors to create a large pool of capital
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Professional management:</strong> A professional fund manager
          invests this pooled money in a variety of securities, such as stocks,
          bonds, and money market instruments.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Diversification:</strong> By spreading investments across many
          different assets, mutual funds reduce the risk associated with any
          single investment. If one security performs poorly, its effect on the
          overall fund is minimized.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Professional expertise</strong> Fund managers analyze
          investments and make decisions to achieve the fund's objectives,
          providing professional management for investors.
        </li>
      </ul>
