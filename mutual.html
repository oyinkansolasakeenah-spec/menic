      <h1>Mutual Funds</h1>
      <p>
        A <strong>mutual fund</strong> is an investment vehicle that pools money
        from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities
        like stocks, bonds, and money market instruments, all managed by
        professional fund managers.
      </p>

        becoming a part-owner of all its underlying assets. The fund manager
        makes investment decisions (buying and selling securities) on your
        behalf, aiming to achieve the fund's stated investment objectives.
      </p>

          securities in the portfolio, minus expenses, divided by the number of
          outstanding shares.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Returns:</strong> Investors earn money from mutual funds in three primary ways:</li>
